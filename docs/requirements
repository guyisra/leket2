isuf file has format with columns of
- pickup priority id
- date
- priority user id
- user name
- user phone
- user email
- priority supplier id
- priority supplier name
- status
- array of <sub suppliers id, sub supplier name>


after collection, the output file should be exported with format:
- pickup priority id
- date
- main supplier id
- warehouse priority id
- pickup reason id
- sub supplier priority id
- priority food type id
- priority container id
- quantity

if there is no collection from a main supplier, the output should be of format
- pickup priority id
- date
- main supplier priority id
- "X" (technically its the warehouse id, but there is none)
- pickup reason id (in this case, there was no pickup, so it should be 03 or 06)

the output file should be a csv with tabs (tsv)

Outputting the file should be append only (as leket will remove read row)


Pages the should be:
- Some kind of login page (if they go to the app independently)
- List of their pickups
- within a pickup, the main supplier name, and the sub suppliers
 - plus a form for each, the warehouse, and pickup reason if needed.
 - There should be a room for comments (if needed), possibly per sub supplier
- Leket should have an admin page, where they will be able to control all data
before being exported. For the beginning, only approved pickups will be exported

For maintenance purposes, there is no need to save data on pickups in DB beyond
X amount of time, where X depends on the DB chosen and what we will agree from leket
